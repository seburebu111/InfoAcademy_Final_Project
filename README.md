As part of the InfoAcademy Java Course, I was required to develop an application in Java (in NetBeans) with a purpose similar to a phone agenda. The app uses a file-saving/file-opening system to build a database of phone contacts, each containing the following information: first name, last name, phone number (mobile/fix), birthday. As imagined, there are functions for deleting, editing, adding new contact (IMG_1), filtering and ordering the list.

Furthermore, the app offers the possibility of surfing the app in two ways: as a non-administrator, the database canâ€™t be saved in a file, nor imported from a file, there are advertisements at the bottom of the app (IMG_2) or, by logging in (IMG_3), as an administrator, without adds and there are file-saving/file-opening functions (IMG_4). There is also a splash screen featured, appearing whenever the app is opened (IMG_5).

To ensure optimal performance and bug-free user experience, I have also developed an error and troubleshooting system that effectively observes issues or user input mistakes and addresses them (IMG_6).
